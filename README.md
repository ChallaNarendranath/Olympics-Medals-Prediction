# Olympics-Medals-Prediction
An ML model for predicting olympic medals in next olympics for each country.
This machine learning model uses linear regression to predict Olympic medal counts based on team features like number of athletes and past medals. It analyzes correlations, handles missing data, trains on pre-2012 data, tests on later years, and evaluates accuracy using mean absolute error.

We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on Kaggle.
